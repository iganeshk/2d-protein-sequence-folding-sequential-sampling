# Predicting 2D Protein Sequence Folding using Sequential Sampling Edit

One Paragraph of project description goes here

### Prerequisites

python-2

```
Give examples
```
### Installing
```
git pull https://github.com/iganeshk/2d-protein-sequence-folding-sequential-sampling.git

```
### Examples

To generate conformations and plots for a give 2D HP sequence

```
python sequence_plot.py generate HPPPHHHPH
```

To generate plots only
```
python sequence_plot.py plot HPPPHHHPH
```
This command will only plot if the conformations of the sequence exists in the executing directory else ask to generate again.
